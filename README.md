# BublearnGame

Bublearn Game is a educational game for children to learn writing. The original version is in English, I am working on a German version. 

# Instructions

- Choose one level: easy, medium or hard.
- Pop the bubble and move the letter by clicking on it.
- You made a mistake? No problem. Click on the letter, and it will go back into the bubbles. Click on the X and all will disappear. 
- If you think your word is correct, click ok!

Have fun playing this game, it is even a lot of fun for adults! Thank you for reading!
